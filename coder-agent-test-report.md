# Coder Agent Test Report - claude-flow v2.0.0

## Test Summary
- **Date**: 2025-07-07
- **Agent**: Coder Agent
- **Purpose**: Test code generation, file operations, and batch processing capabilities

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Successfully Tested Features

1. **MultiEdit Capability**
   - Created new files with content
   - Applied multiple edits to existing files in a single operation
   - Status: ‚úÖ Working correctly

2. **Write Operations**
   - Created multiple files: `test-calculator.js`, `test-calculator.test.js`, `test-batch-operations.json`
   - All files created successfully
   - Status: ‚úÖ Working correctly

3. **Memory Storage**
   - Successfully stored test results using: `claude-flow memory store`
   - Key: `coder-test-results`
   - Status: ‚úÖ Working correctly

4. **Batch File Operations**
   - Created calculator module with full documentation
   - Added test files
   - Enhanced module with additional functions (power, sqrt)
   - Status: ‚úÖ Working correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered

1. **Hook Commands**
   - `npx claude-flow hook` commands not available
   - These appear to be from ruv-swarm MCP, not claude-flow itself
   - Status: ‚ùå Not available in claude-flow

2. **SPARC Mode**
   - `claude-flow sparc run code` encountered error: "Cannot read properties of undefined"
   - May need additional configuration or dependencies
   - Status: ‚ùå Needs investigation

### üìä Code Generation Test

Successfully created a calculator module with:
- Basic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Enhanced operations: power, sqrt
- Error handling (division by zero, negative square root)
- JSDoc documentation
- Unit tests using Jest

### üîß Available Commands Verified

```bash
claude-flow start    # Enhanced orchestration system
claude-flow status   # System status (verified working)
claude-flow monitor  # Real-time monitoring
claude-flow session  # Session management
claude-flow memory   # Memory operations (verified working)
claude-flow sparc    # TDD development (needs fix)
```

## Recommendations

1. **Use claude-flow native commands** instead of ruv-swarm hooks
2. **Memory operations work well** for storing coordination data
3. **Batch operations** can be achieved through sequential tool calls
4. **SPARC mode** needs debugging - use direct file operations as workaround

## Conclusion

claude-flow v2.0.0 provides robust file operations and memory capabilities. While some features like SPARC mode need fixes, the core functionality for code generation and batch processing works well. The MultiEdit tool is particularly effective for making multiple changes efficiently.
